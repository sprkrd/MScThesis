We have explored several techniques for dealing with problems from a recycling domain
from the planning perspective.
We have used the MDP formalization, combined with task decomposition and automatic identification
of precedences to bound the complexity o planning.

Perhaps the main point to improve of our project is the implementation of the Hindsight
Optimizer, since it seems unable to do timely decisions in most of the problems. However,
for our purposes $\alpha$-Cost-Transition-Likelihood seemed to perform well. In the future
we would like to explore options to make this determinization method more robust against
dead-ends.

While the simplification of the planning problems, as described in Chapter~\ref{chap:short-horizon-planning} seems good from a conceptual point of view, we still
have to find problems that are complex enough to show its virtues.
